# PDF-Langchain-Bot
This project allows users to interact with multiple PDF documents through an intelligent conversational interface. It leverages custom embeddings and a language model (LLM) to process, store, and retrieve information from uploaded PDFs. The application is built with Streamlit for the frontend and LangChain for conversational AI capabilities.
